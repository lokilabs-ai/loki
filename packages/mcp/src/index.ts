      "Use @lokiplay/sdk and a host-authoritative room.",
      "Install @lokiplay/sdk for types and local development and import it as usual, but leave it external in the production build only (Vite: build.rollupOptions.external: [\"@lokiplay/sdk\"]). In production Loki serves the SDK from the game host at /loki/sdk.js and maps the import to it, so production may run a newer compatible SDK than the pinned package. Ship an ES module entry, do not import the SDK from a Web Worker, do not register a game service worker that intercepts or caches /loki/sdk.js, and run lokiplay preview on the finished build before lokiplay ship.",
      "Create rooms with createRoom() and join with joinRoom({ inviteCode }). create() stays invite-only unless the game explicitly passes { visibility: \"public\" }. Do not make every room public. Confirm for each mode whether entry is private invites, public room browsing (listPublicRooms + joinPublic), automatic matchmaking, or a combination. Installing the SDK does not add a create/join screen. If the game has no usable room-entry flow, add a minimal lobby or an automatic create/join flow before shipping. Loki's SDK does not add a public lobby screen. If public-room discovery is enabled, the game agent must build the room browser and all loading, empty, joining, full-room, waiting, readiness, and error states. The Loki overlay does not list, create, or join public rooms.",
      "Installing the SDK also does not add Match or Leaderboard screens; both are required alongside create/join. Add a Match control that calls the room wrapper's matchmake() (SynchronizedRoom.matchmake() / RealtimeRoom.matchmake()) with confirmed player/team settings plus searching, cancel, timeout, waiting, and error states, and a per-game Leaderboard using listLeaderboard()/submitLeaderboardScore() with display-name collection or a sensible fallback plus loading, empty, pagination, submission, and error states. Player count, teams, and scoring stay creator decisions; if the game has no numeric result, ask the creator once what to record. Leaderboards are per-game/project and available to guest sessions without a creator account; client-submitted scores are not an anti-cheat boundary.",
      "Inspect the game to establish its multiplayer profile. Do not infer player counts, teams, or simulation type from the game's name or genre. If a material field is ambiguous, stop and ask the creator. Do not invent new game.json fields.",
      "After confirming each mode's profile, choose createSynchronizedRoom for turn-based or event-driven state, or createRealtimeRoom for continuous realtime. Host is more suitable for turn-based and event-driven games. Server is more suitable for continuous realtime games. Do not choose by genre or animation smoothness. A server step's next state must depend only on the previous state and that tick's inputs.",
      "createSynchronizedRoom: keep synchronized state compact and JSON-compatible; reducers must be synchronous, deterministic, and free of rendering, timers, networking, or other I/O.",
      "createRealtimeRoom: integrate the game's existing simulation through its predict/interpolate/extrapolate/blendCorrection/shouldCorrect/composeRenderState callbacks instead of a parallel input queue, RTT estimator, snapshot pacer, stale-round rejection, input ledger, interpolation buffer, or reconnect netcode; the SDK owns per-submission in-flight accounting and setInput() network pacing too. For multi-entity games, use getRenderStates()/composeRenderState (or the createEntityCompositor/createLocalPrediction helpers, preferring the bulk setEntities over setEntity for many entities) to render each entity from the stream that fits it (predicted for local, interpolated/latestAuthoritative for remotes) instead of predicting every entity, which diverges after collisions. publishSnapshot() already coalesces multiple same-turn calls to a single send; do not build a separate coalescing layer. Use sendEffect()/onConfirmedEffect() to confirm authoritative events (e.g. collisions) with a stable id instead of a custom event-confirmation channel, so speculative local particles/audio can be deduped against the confirmed outcome. Use createHostedLokiClient() to own the hosted-shell loki:init/loki:session handshake at page boot instead of hand-writing it. Keep one game-owned render loop, keep authoritative snapshots compact and self-contained. snapshotHz (default 30, cap 100) is a ceiling, not a delivery guarantee: start conservative with adaptiveRate: true and a low initialSnapshotHz, or use calibrateRealtimeRoom() against a real two-player pair (fixed snapshotHz per candidate) to pick the highest delivered rate without a transport/hold/ack cliff and write only that RealtimeProfile into createRealtimeRoom(); game.json tickRate is a separate Nakama room-loop setting and must not be copied from snapshotHz. Report the selected rates plus observed diagnostics (including acceptance/rejection ratios, held authoritative frames, and onDiagnosticWarning events) as evidence. Loki does not supply physics, collision, rendering optimization, or competitive integrity for realtime rooms.",
      "Let the SDK own page lifecycle, socket replacement, retries, snapshots, and pending-action replay. Keep the same client and room while interrupted. Never leave, close, disconnect, reload, or replace a room because of visibility, page, focus, or network lifecycle events.",
      "Dispatch only while connected. During suspended, reconnecting, or resynchronizing, lock authoritative input, preserve rendered state, show a temporary reconnecting message, and wait for an authoritative snapshot. Do not assume host authority survives reconnect.",
      "For a synchronized room, every control that commits a match action calls dispatch() while connection is connected. Decide whether the player can act from the latest snapshot, and use that same check for the control and for the handler. Draw the committed result from the snapshot that comes back. Aim, hover, and animation stay local. The same control works for the host and for every other member. If the player cannot act, or dispatch() rejects or throws, show that on the control. Do not ignore the input, and do not apply the committed result on the acting client before the snapshot arrives.",
      "Do not repeat unresolved actions under new IDs. Treat indeterminate confirmation as an unknown outcome, room_closed as terminal, and leave_failed as requiring resolution before another room.",
      "Keep the same client and synchronized room while a match is interrupted, but between matches await leave() on the old room, stop listening to it, and create a fresh createSynchronizedRoom() for the next match instead of reusing the old room object.",
      "Do not put credentials, access tokens, deployment secrets, private keys, or environment-secret values in code, game.json, logs, commits, or reports, and never ask the user to paste a token or deployment credential. Before any browser action that needs login, OAuth, permissions, external account access, or a deployment confirmation, pause and ask the user for explicit approval.",
      "If lokiplay ship or connect reports that the game is inactive, stop and tell the user to press Reactivate for this project in the Loki dashboard, then ship again. Do not create another project to get around it.",
      "The upload is the finished browser build only, within 25 MiB compressed, 100 MiB uncompressed, and 1000 files. If lokiplay init created game.json, its multiplayer values (host, maxPlayers 8, tickRate 30) are placeholders, not a confirmed profile; replace them with the confirmed values for this game.",
      "Starting another match from the menu: await leave() to completion before create(), join(), joinPublic(), or matchmake(); skip it only when connection is idle. Do not treat closed or failed as already left while a room id is still held; call leave() and retry after leave_failed. Reset game-local match state whenever the room id changes. Every Creating, Joining, and Searching screen needs a timeout, an error message, and a way back to the menu.",
      "Start the match from the roster, not from one flag: begin once the minimum number of members are present and the local player has a seat. Do not gate the start on membership === \"ready\" alone; it can read synchronizing briefly while the roster is restored. While fewer members are present, show the invite code with a player count such as 1 / 2.",
      "When a mode's confirmed entry is private invites plus public rooms, show both a Create private room control and a Create public room control (create({ visibility: \"public\" })), and a public room list built on listPublicRooms() and joinPublic({ roomId }) with loading, empty, joining, full, waiting, and error states.",
      "Use a mobile viewport with viewport-fit=cover without globally disabling zoom. Fill 100dvh with a 100vh fallback, account for safe areas, recalculate container layout on viewport changes, and avoid document scrolling during play.",
      "Use Pointer Events across touch and desktop input, scoped touch-action, pointer capture and cancellation handling, 44x44 CSS-pixel primary targets, and no hover-only controls.",
      "For canvas games, separate CSS and backing size, cap devicePixelRatio reasonably, and resize and redraw without replacing the canvas. Use one controlled requestAnimationFrame loop and pause or throttle rendering while hidden without leaving the room.",
      "Report mobile Safari and Android Chrome coverage without claiming real-device testing unless it actually occurred.",
      "Production multiplayer requires a Loki-hosted build.",
