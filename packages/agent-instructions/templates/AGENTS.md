# Loki integration rules

- Install and use `@lokiplay/sdk`; do not import Nakama APIs into game code.
- Production multiplayer runs only from a Loki-hosted finished browser build.
- Hosted SDK: install `@lokiplay/sdk` for types and local development and
  import it as usual, but leave it external in the production build only
  (Vite: `build.rollupOptions.external: ["@lokiplay/sdk"]`). In production
  Loki serves the SDK from the game host at `/loki/sdk.js` and maps the
  import to it, so production may run a newer compatible SDK than the pinned
  package and networking fixes arrive on refresh. Ship an ES module entry
  (`<script type="module">`); a classic single-file bundle cannot use the
  import map. Do not import the SDK from a Web Worker, and do not register a
  game service worker that intercepts or caches `/loki/sdk.js`. Run
  `lokiplay preview` on the finished build before `lokiplay ship`; the
  multiplayer session handshake only runs inside the Loki play page.
- Upload `game.json`, `index.html`, and static assets. Do not upload source-only
  repositories, backend processes, secrets, creator ad scripts, or localhost
  dependencies. The upload is the finished browser build only, within 25 MiB
  compressed, 100 MiB uncompressed, and 1000 files. Verify the built output,
  not only the source.
- Do not put credentials, access tokens, deployment secrets, private keys, or
  environment-secret values in code, `game.json`, logs, commits, or reports.
  Never ask the user to paste a token or deployment credential. Before any
  browser action that needs login, OAuth, permissions, external account
  access, or a deployment confirmation, pause and ask the user for explicit
  approval.
- If `lokiplay ship` or `connect` reports that the game is inactive, stop and
  tell the user to press Reactivate for this project in the Loki dashboard,
  then ship again. Do not create another project to get around it.
- Loki controls identity, tenant boundaries, membership, matchmaking,
  sequencing, snapshots, and host migration. Authority per project is set in
  `game.json` and chosen below.
- Never trust or override the `projectId`, player identity, room membership,
  host assignment, sequence, or snapshots returned by Loki.
- Create rooms with `createRoom()` and join with `joinRoom({ inviteCode })`.
  Do not invent Loki room keys or pass player-typed codes to `createRoom`.
  `create()` stays invite-only unless the game explicitly passes
  `{ visibility: "public" }`. Every game offers both: a private room that is
  joined by invite code, and a public room that appears in a public room list.
  Do not make every room public. Loki’s SDK does not add a public lobby screen;
  the game agent must build the room browser and all loading, empty, joining,
  full-room, waiting, readiness, and error states. The Loki overlay does not
  list, create, or join public rooms.
- Run the room flow through the SDK's lobby controller, and build every screen
  yourself. Call `client.createLobby({ makeRoom, minPlayers, leaderboardId })`,
  where `makeRoom` returns a fresh `createSynchronizedRoom()` or
  `createRealtimeRoom()` for each match. The controller draws nothing: read
  `lobby.getState()` (and `lobby.subscribe()`) and render it. `phase` is
  `menu`, `creating`, `joining`, `searching`, `waiting`, `ready`, `leaving`, or
  `error`; `state.room` has the invite code and the roster count against
  `minPlayers`; `state.publicRooms` and `state.leaderboard` each carry their own
  loading, ready, and error status. Actions are `createPrivate()`,
  `createPublic({ modeLabel })`, `joinWithCode(code)`, `joinPublic(roomId)`,
  `refreshPublicRooms()`, `matchmake({ minPlayers, maxPlayers, teamSize })`,
  `cancelSearch()`, `leave()`, `loadLeaderboard()`, `loadMoreLeaderboard()`, and
  `submitScore(score, { displayName })`. Use `lobby.getRoom()` for `dispatch()`
  and the realtime calls. A call made while another entry is in flight is
  ignored, so a double click is safe. Do not hand-write create/join/leave
  sequencing, timeouts, or match start logic around it.
- Installing the SDK, or using the lobby controller, does not add any screen,
  and the Loki overlay never draws them. Build these screens in the game's own
  theme, with its art direction, fonts, colors, and controls, not an unstyled
  default, and keep them usable on touch and on desktop:
  - Create room, join with an invite code, copy invite, and start when ready.
  - A Create private room control and a Create public room control, a public
    room list (`refreshPublicRooms()`), and join from that list.
  - A Match control (`matchmake()`) with confirmed player/team settings, plus
    searching, a cancel control (`cancelSearch()`), timeout, waiting, and error
    states.
  - A per-game Leaderboard with display-name collection or a sensible fallback,
    plus loading, empty, pagination (`loadMoreLeaderboard()`), submission, and
    error states.
  - Loading, waiting, and error states on every screen. Show `state.error`.

  Public rooms, Match, and the Leaderboard are required in every game; do not
  ask the creator whether to build them. Player count, teams, and scoring stay
  creator decisions from the confirmed profile; if the game has no numeric
  result to store, ask the creator once what to record instead of inventing a
  scoring rule. Leaderboards are per-game/project and available to guest
  sessions without a creator account; client-submitted scores are not an
  anti-cheat boundary.
- Before configuring Loki multiplayer, inspect the game's source, existing UI,
  configuration, documentation, tests, and finished build. Locate its game
  modes, seats, local-player handling, AI opponents, teams, start conditions,
  turn or update loop, win conditions, reconnect behavior, and existing
  networking code.
- Do not infer multiplayer requirements from the game's name, genre,
  appearance, or common rules. A chess, pool, racing, or strategy game may
  support different player and team arrangements.
- Determine requirements separately for every supported game mode. Do not
  collapse multiple modes into one profile.
- Record evidence for each conclusion and distinguish observed facts from
  creator decisions. If any material field is ambiguous, stop and ask the
  creator. Never silently choose a player count, team arrangement, simulation
  model, authority model, update frequency, persistence policy, or
  matchmaking flow.
- Determine and confirm for each mode: minimum, recommended, and maximum
  players; number of teams, team size, and whether players share control;
  whether late
  joining and spectators are allowed; turn-based, event-driven, continuous
  realtime, or hybrid simulation; sequential or simultaneous input; required
  authoritative update frequency and latency sensitivity; session duration
  and persistence requirements; host-authoritative trust tolerance or
  server-authority requirement.
- Classify simulation from how authoritative state progresses, not from
  visual animation. A game animated at 60 FPS may still be turn-based or
  event-driven.
- Preserve existing game modes and rules. Add online settings and entry UI
  from the confirmed profile, including mode selection, team or seat
  selection, readiness, player limits, invite and join behavior, waiting
  states, and start conditions.
- Do not invent new `game.json` fields. Current manifests accept only
  `enabled`, `authority`, `maxPlayers`, `tickRate`, and — only when
  `authority` is `"server"` — `step`. Report the richer profile in the
  final report: values, supporting evidence, and creator-confirmed
  decisions.
- If `lokiplay init` created `game.json`, its `multiplayer` values (host,
  `maxPlayers` 8, `tickRate` 30) are placeholders, not a confirmed profile.
  Replace them with the confirmed values for this game.
- Host authority is the default for every game, turn-based or continuous
  realtime. Write `"authority": "host"`, omit `step`, and use
  `createSynchronizedRoom()` for turn-based or event-driven state or
  `createRealtimeRoom()` for continuous realtime. Classify the room type from
  the code that advances match state, not from the genre or the frame rate:
  turn-based or event-driven means state changes only when a player action is
  committed; continuous realtime means state advances on a tick even when
  nobody has just pressed a button. If that reading is ambiguous, stop and
  ask the creator what the match state depends on. Do not guess.
- Server authority is opt-in. Enable it only when the creator asks for it.
  Never choose it yourself, and never suggest it because a game is realtime.
  It needs a paid plan (Loki or Loki Pro; Free ships host authority only, and
  the ship is refused otherwise) and a pure step module, so tell the creator
  both before you start. When the creator asks, write
  `"authority": "server"` and `step`. Do not elect a player host. Server
  rooms are browser-only, run in Singapore, and end if the step fails; they
  do not fall back to a player. That is fairness, not lower latency. The
  viewer clock follows `tickRate`. Leave `simulationHz` as the local
  prediction step. Do not set `simulationHz` equal to `tickRate` to unstick
  presentation.
- One `game.json` has one `authority` for the whole project. If modes
  disagree, say so and ask which one this project is.
- Before compiling `step`, change the state update so the next state depends
  only on the previous state and this tick's inputs. Drawing, sound, and
  asset loads stay in the browser. If the update reads the DOM, the clock,
  randomness, or assets, remove those calls from it. A seed or the tick
  index, when the game needs one, is an input field, not something the
  module reads itself. If you cannot make that change, say so and keep
  `"authority": "host"`. The worker also meters each tick (a fixed budget of
  guest function calls, 20 ms, and 3 MiB of memory), so keep the step cheap
  and check it against those limits before you ship.
- `step` names a compiled `.wasm` module (`modulePath`) exporting exactly
  one function, `step`, and importing nothing — no WASI, clocks, randomness,
  or host functions. Compile it yourself. The validator rejects imports, and
  the worker never mounts anything else.
- A later switch is another deploy after the creator confirms again. Rooms
  already open keep the authority they started with.
- After inspecting and confirming each game mode's profile, choose
  `createSynchronizedRoom()` for turn-based or event-driven state, or
  `createRealtimeRoom()` for continuous realtime. Do not choose by genre or
  animation smoothness; choose by how authoritative state actually
  progresses. Do not run both room types for the same mode.
- `createSynchronizedRoom()`: define project-owned state and actions, then
  provide a reducer. Do not implement a parallel authority, version, or
  membership protocol.
- Keep shared state JSON-compatible and use finite safe integers. Reducers must
  be synchronous, deterministic, and fast. Do not perform rendering, timers,
  network calls, or other I/O inside a reducer. Keep transient visual and
  interpolation data out of synchronized state.
- Subscribe to synchronized snapshots for state, members, authority, and
  connection status. Keep the same `LokiClient` and synchronized-room instance
  while interrupted. That applies to one match only: between matches,
  `await leave()` on the old room, stop listening to it, and create a fresh
  `createSynchronizedRoom()` for the next match instead of reusing the old
  room object (the lobby controller does this when `makeRoom` returns a new
  room). Let the SDK own browser lifecycle detection, socket
  replacement, reconnect retries, snapshot recovery, and pending-action replay.
- `createRealtimeRoom()`: integrate the game's existing simulation through
  `RealtimeRoom`'s callbacks (predict/interpolate/extrapolate/blendCorrection/
  shouldCorrect/composeRenderState) rather than writing a parallel input queue, RTT estimator, snapshot pacer,
  stale-round rejection, input ledger, interpolation buffer, or reconnect
  netcode; the SDK already owns all of that, including per-submission
  in-flight accounting (a rejected or silently-dropped snapshot always
  releases its slot) and genuine `inputHz` pacing for `setInput()` (call it
  every frame; the SDK paces/coalesces the network send). Keep one
  game-owned render loop driven by `advanceFrame()`/`getRenderState()`
  (call each at most once per rendered frame). Keep authoritative
  snapshots compact and self-contained (no references to transient
  local-only state).
- `snapshotHz` (default 30, cap 100) is a ceiling, not a delivery guarantee. Do
  not default to the highest rate. Start conservative — pass
  `adaptiveRate: true` (the floor and the starting rate are both 12 Hz) or
  an explicit fixed `snapshotHz` — and raise the ceiling toward your game's
  best setting only with diagnostic evidence. You may raise `snapshotHz`
  (cap 100) and the candidate list to find the best rate for this game. Prefer `calibrateRealtimeRoom()`
  over guessing: it exercises candidate rates against a real two-client
  `RealtimeRoom` pair at a fixed `snapshotHz` (`adaptiveRate: false` on
  the candidate rooms) and recommends the highest rate that is actually
  delivered without a Loki-owned cliff (acceptance, delivery match,
  extrapolation, held authoritative frames, ack latency, backpressure).
  Optional `evaluate()` can only veto a rate. Write only the returned
  `RealtimeProfile` into `createRealtimeRoom()` (`adaptiveRate: true`,
  `minSnapshotHz: 12`, `initialSnapshotHz` 12 or the ceiling if lower). If
  no candidate qualifies, use that floor profile (12 Hz, adaptive); if
  the sweep is incomplete, calibration throws — fix the run and repeat,
  do not invent a profile. `game.json` `tickRate` is a separate Nakama
  room-loop setting; do not copy `snapshotHz` into it. `publishSnapshot()`
  already coalesces multiple calls made within the same synchronous turn
  to a single send; do not build a separate coalescing layer for that.
  Report the calibrated or selected snapshot/input rates and the observed
  diagnostics (RTT, jitter, acceptance/rejection ratios, reconnect/
  migration duration, dropped/coalesced frames, held authoritative
  frames, and any `onDiagnosticWarning` events) as evidence, not
  assumptions.
- For multi-entity games, prefer the `createEntityCompositor`/
  `createLocalPrediction` helpers over hand-writing `composeRenderState`/
  `predict` selection logic; they cover the "predict/compose the local
  entity, interpolate the rest" plumbing while the game still supplies the
  selectors for its own State shape. Use `setEntities` (bulk, once per
  frame) over `setEntity` (once per entity) for games with many entities.
  Use `sendEffect()`/`onConfirmedEffect()` to confirm authoritative events
  (e.g. collisions) with a stable id instead of a custom
  event-confirmation channel, so speculative local particles or audio can
  be deduped against the confirmed outcome.
- For hosted sandbox games, call `createHostedLokiClient({ projectId })`
  once at page boot and reuse the client it returns for every
  Create/Join. It installs the `loki:init` listener and requests the
  session immediately, rather than deferring authentication to a
  Create/Join button click — deferring it risks the hosted shell's own
  ~15s "Connecting…" timeout elapsing first. Do not hand-write that
  handshake.
- Do not claim Loki supplies game physics, collision resolution, rendering
  optimization, or competitive/anti-cheat integrity for `createRealtimeRoom()`
  games. Loki owns transport, sequencing, fencing, and delivery only; the game
  owns simulation and rendering.
- `createRealtimeRoom()` requires every present room member to be
  realtime-capable before it activates; a legacy or non-realtime-capable
  client blocks activation and cannot join an already-active realtime room.
  Native clients cannot join realtime-mode rooms until a later parity
  release; do not offer `createRealtimeRoom()` for cross-client modes yet.
- Do not implement competing reconnect behavior for `visibilitychange`,
  `pagehide`, `pageshow`, `blur`, `focus`, `online`, or `offline`. Never call
  `leave()`, `close()`, transport disconnect, or create a replacement room
  because the page became hidden, blurred, offline, or unloaded. Call `leave()`
  only for an explicit user Leave/End Game action.
- Call `dispatch()` only while `connection` is `connected`. For `suspended`,
  `reconnecting`, or `resynchronizing`, lock authoritative input, preserve the
  last rendered state, show a temporary reconnecting message, and wait for an
  authoritative snapshot. Do not assume the player is still host afterward.
  The lobby controller does the switch for you: `lobby.getState().room.canAct`
  is true only while connected, and `room.connectionNotice` holds a short
  message for every other state (or call `describeConnection(room.connection)`
  for a room you manage yourself). Gate every match control on `canAct` and
  show the notice in the game's own theme; do not write your own switch over
  `connection`.
- For a synchronized room, every control that commits a match action calls
  `dispatch()` while `connection` is `connected`. Decide whether the player
  can act from the latest snapshot, and use that same check for the control
  and for the handler. Draw the committed result from the snapshot that comes
  back. Aim, hover, and animation stay local. The same control works for the
  host and for every other member. If the player cannot act, or `dispatch()`
  rejects or throws, show that on the control. Do not ignore the input, and
  do not apply the committed result on the acting client before the snapshot
  arrives.
- Loki replays unresolved actions with the same `(senderId, actionId)`. Do not
  repeat one under a new action ID. Treat `indeterminate` or "authoritative
  confirmation timed out" as an unknown outcome, not proof of failure. Treat
  `room_closed` as terminal. Resolve `leave_failed` before starting another
  room with that client.
- The lobby controller already does the next three rules. Follow them yourself
  only for a room the game manages outside the controller. Starting another
  match from the menu: `await leave()` to completion before
  `create()`, `join()`, `joinPublic()`, or `matchmake()`. Skip it only when
  `connection` is `idle`. Do not treat `closed` or `failed` as already left
  while a room id is still held; call `leave()` and retry after
  `leave_failed`. Reset game-local match state (boards, turn, seat, result)
  whenever the room id changes. Every "Creating…", "Joining…", and
  "Searching…" screen needs a timeout, an error message, and a way back to
  the menu; never leave a screen waiting on a promise that may not settle.
- Start the match from the roster, not from one flag. Begin once at least the
  minimum number of members are present and the local player has a seat. Do
  not gate the start on `membership === "ready"` alone; it can read
  `synchronizing` briefly while the roster is restored. While fewer members
  are present, show the invite code with a player count such as "1 / 2".
- Every game shows both a Create private room control and a Create public room
  control (`createPrivate()` / `createPublic()`, or
  `create({ visibility: "public" })` on a room you manage yourself), and a
  public room list built on `refreshPublicRooms()` (or `listPublicRooms()` and
  `joinPublic({ roomId })`) with loading, empty, joining, full, waiting, and
  error states.
- Handle rejected actions from `dispatch()` without inventing a parallel
  protocol.
- Include `<meta name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">`. Do not
  globally disable browser zoom. Make the game root `width: 100%`,
  `height: 100vh`, then `height: 100dvh`, with `overflow: hidden`. Account for
  `env(safe-area-inset-*)`; gameplay must not require document scrolling,
  though internal menus may scroll.
- Recalculate layout from the game container on resize. Handle
  `visualViewport.resize` when available and `orientationchange` as a fallback.
  Preserve logical game coordinates and fit them to the available area instead
  of hard-coding desktop pixels. Support both orientations unless the game
  clearly explains a required orientation.
- For canvas games, separate CSS size from backing resolution, scale the
  backing store by `devicePixelRatio` with a reasonable cap such as 2, and
  resize and redraw after viewport changes without replacing the canvas node.
  Keep critical controls inside safe-area boundaries.
- Use Pointer Events for touch, mouse, pen, and trackpad. Apply
  `touch-action: none` only to a direct-manipulation playfield, use pointer
  capture for dragging or aiming, handle `pointercancel` and lost capture, make
  primary targets at least 44x44 CSS pixels, and do not rely on hover.
- Use one controlled `requestAnimationFrame` rendering loop. Pause or throttle
  rendering while hidden without leaving the Loki room, then render the latest
  authoritative snapshot. Cap canvas resolution and avoid allocating large
  buffers every frame.
- Loki-hosted games run in a sandbox iframe with a strict CSP. Do not use
  inline `<script>` tags, inline event handlers, Google Fonts or other remote
  stylesheets, or `<form>` submissions. Put JavaScript and fonts in same-origin
  files and use `<button type="button">` for create/join controls.
- Run `npx lokiplay preview` on the finished build, then `npx lokiplay ship`.
  Report whether mobile Safari and Android Chrome were tested; never claim
  real-device testing unless it was actually performed. Exercise resize, orientation changes,
  interrupted gestures, hide/restore, temporary offline recovery, host
  migration, and return after an extended background period when the available
  test environment supports them.
- For `createRealtimeRoom()` games, run one required two-client calibration
  test to get real diagnostics rather than tuning by feel: two distinct
  player identities (two isolated browser contexts/profiles, or two
  real players — two tabs sharing one signed-in player are not two
  players) driving the game's real `predict`/`interpolate`/`setInput`/
  `publishSnapshot` wiring through `calibrateRealtimeRoom()` or an
  equivalent sweep, reading Loki's own diagnostics (not a
  game-invented HUD) as the shared signal. Prefer running it against the
  real hosted play URL (through `createHostedLokiClient()`'s handshake);
  if browser automation cannot drive the hosted iframe, run it against a
  local/preview build with two real player sessions injected instead. If
  that test skipped the hosted iframe, also run one short hosted-shell
  smoke check (one page load of the real play URL, confirming the
  handshake completes and a room can be created before the shell's own
  timeout) so a working calibration cannot ship alongside a broken
  hosted bootstrap. Write only the returned `RealtimeProfile` into
  `createRealtimeRoom()`. Do not copy `snapshotHz` into `game.json`
  `tickRate`. Do not pick a lowest-healthy rate or invent a second
  profile. `evaluate()` is optional; skip it unless the game already
  measures error. If calibration throws, fix the harness and rerun.
