        <p>Effective date: 1 September 2026</p>
        <p>Version: terms-2026-10-07</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a legally binding agreement between you and Reveflo Technologies Limited, a company incorporated in Hong Kong (“Reveflo”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), for Loki.</p>
        <p>The Service is the websites and applications at lokiplay.cc, app.lokiplay.cc, play.lokiplay.cc, and docs.lokiplay.cc, the API at api.lokiplay.cc, per-game hosts, software development kits, command-line tools, agent integrations, hosting, multiplayer, chat, leaderboards, and related services we make available.</p>
        <p>By creating an account, accepting these Terms in the product, paying for a plan, deploying a game, or playing a game, you agree to these Terms, the Privacy Policy (version privacy-2026-10-07), and the Acceptable Use Policy (version aup-2026-10-07) (the “AUP”).</p>
        <p>Questions and legal notices: <a href="mailto:contact@lokiplay.cc">contact@lokiplay.cc</a></p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="1-definitions">1. Definitions</h2>
        <p>“Account” means a Loki creator account authenticated through our identity provider.</p>
        <p>“Creator” means a person who uses an Account to create projects, upload builds, or operate games. If you act for an organisation, “you” includes that organisation.</p>
        <p>“Player” means a person who plays a game on the Service, including as a guest.</p>
        <p>“Content” means software, builds, step modules, assets, text, chat, display names, scores, metadata, and other material submitted to or sent through the Service.</p>
        <p>“Game Content” means Content a Creator submits for a project, including finished builds, manifests, step modules, and connected-repository materials.</p>
        <p>“User Content” means Content a Player submits, including chat, display names, scores, and reports.</p>
        <p>“SDK” means Loki’s JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, and Unity libraries, the command-line tool, the MCP server, and agent instruction packages. In a hosted browser game, production loads the JavaScript SDK from the game host.</p>
        <p>“Plan” means Free, Loki, or Loki Pro, or a custom plan we agree in writing.</p>
        <p>“Business day” means a day other than a Saturday, a Sunday, or a public holiday in Hong Kong.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="2-the-service">2. The Service</h2>
        <p>2.1 Loki hosts finished browser builds and provides rooms, invites, public rooms within a game, fill-N and team matchmaking, presence, lobby and match chat, and per-game leaderboards. Production multiplayer runs on a Loki-hosted build.</p>
        <p>2.2 Host authority is the default. One Player is elected simulation host. We check that the sender is the current host, sequence messages, and migrate the host if that Player leaves. A host can affect game state. This mode is for casual, cooperative, party, turn-based, and unranked play.</p>
        <p>2.3 Server authority is available on the Loki and Loki Pro plans when the Creator ships a pure step module. We run that module. No Player is host. The module must export one step function, import nothing, and compute the next state only from the previous state and that tick’s inputs. Drawing, sound, and asset loads stay in the browser. Server-authoritative rooms run in Singapore, are browser-only, and end if the step fails. They do not fall back to a Player host. Server authority is a fairness boundary for that match. It is not ranked anti-cheat, and it is not a Creator-operated backend.</p>
        <p>2.4 Each project has one authority at a time. Rooms already open keep the authority they started with. Changing authority requires a new ship.</p>
        <p>2.5 We store accepted browser releases and serve them from a sandboxed game origin. We keep the latest releases for each project and may remove older ones. We do not run Creator-supplied backends, and we do not compile Creator source on Loki. Native iOS, Android, and Unity applications may use the SDK for synchronized rooms. Distribution of those binaries on Apple, Google, or another store stays with the Creator. Realtime rooms are a browser capability.</p>
        <p>2.6 Private and unlisted play links are part of the current Service, within Plan limits. A creator can make a link private or public, or deactivate a game, from the dashboard. Public catalog publication is closed. A paid Plan does not put a game into a public catalog.</p>
        <p>2.7 Tips, platform advertising, creator payouts, friends, parties, and public leaderboards are not part of the current Service.</p>
        <p>2.8 For hosted browser games, we serve /loki/sdk.js from the game host. Within a compatibility version, that file may be newer than the @lokiplay/sdk package the Creator installed, so compatible networking fixes can reach Players on refresh. Each web release replaces that file for every game, and we may roll back to the previous file. Removing or renaming an SDK export requires a new compatibility version and a game rebuild. Native packages are not updated this way.</p>
        <p>2.9 We may change, throttle, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Service, including by quota enforcement or an emergency kill switch.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="3-eligibility">3. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>3.1 You must be at least 13 years old.</p>
        <p>3.2 If you are under 18, a parent or legal guardian must accept these Terms for you and is responsible for your use.</p>
        <p>3.3 You must be able to use the Service under Hong Kong law and the law of your residence. You must not use the Service if sanctions or export controls prohibit you from receiving it.</p>
        <p>3.4 If you act for an organisation, you represent that you can bind it.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="4-accounts-and-guests">4. Accounts and guests</h2>
        <p>4.1 A Creator Account requires an email address and password, or sign-in with Google or GitHub, and acceptance of the then-current Terms, Privacy Policy, and AUP. We store the accepted versions: terms-2026-10-07, privacy-2026-10-07, and aup-2026-10-07, until we publish later versions.</p>
        <p>4.2 You are responsible for your credentials, command-line device authorisations, deployment credentials, and play invites.</p>
        <p>4.3 Guest play does not require an Account. Guest use is still subject to these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and the AUP. We may set a guest cookie so the same guest can be recognised in that project for up to 30 days.</p>
        <p>4.4 Player sessions are short-lived and project-scoped. You must not share, sell, or forge them.</p>
        <p>4.5 We may refuse registration or limit guest sessions.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="5-creators">5. Creators</h2>
        <p>5.1 You may create projects, upload finished builds, ship through the command-line tool, connect GitHub where offered, issue play invites, and operate play within your Plan.</p>
        <p>5.2 You retain ownership of your Game Content, subject to the licences in Section 8.</p>
        <p>5.3 You represent that you have the rights to upload and operate the Game Content, that it complies with the AUP and applicable law, and that it does not infringe other people’s rights. You will not embed third-party ad tags, miners, credential harvesters, remote scripts, or undeclared network endpoints. Long-lived Loki secrets do not belong in source or client builds. For native store games, you remain responsible for the store’s rules.</p>
        <p>5.4 Uploads are scanned. We may refuse, quarantine, disable, or delete a deployment that fails automated checks, assisted review, or human review. A scan that allows a ship is not an approval of the game’s content.</p>
        <p>5.5 If you connect GitHub, you authorise us to create or update only Loki-owned workflow files, receive webhooks, and ingest the configured finished-build artifact. The build runs in GitHub Actions. We do not run your build command on Loki.</p>
        <p>5.6 A step module is Game Content. You are responsible for its rules. We may reject a module that fails validation, fuel, memory, determinism, or safety limits.</p>
        <p>5.7 Quotas are hard caps. The action that would exceed a cap is denied.</p>
        <p>5.8 Current Plan limits, as stated for this version:</p>

        <p>5.9 If the pricing page and the Service disagree, the Service enforces the Plan on the Account. We may change future limits under Section 17.</p>
        <p>5.10 You are responsible for support to your Players, except for platform and safety issues they raise with us.</p>

        <h2 id="6-players">6. Players</h2>
        <p>6.1 You may play games you are allowed to open, join rooms, use matchmaking where the game offers it, chat, submit a display name and score, and appear on that game’s leaderboard.</p>
        <p>6.2 Games are created by Creators, except first-party games we identify. Other Players, hosts, and game rules are outside our control. We are not responsible for Game Content. Leaderboard scores submitted by a client are not an anti-cheat boundary.</p>
        <p>6.3 Chat, display names, and scores must comply with the AUP.</p>
        <p>6.4 You must not escape the sandbox, reach another project, forge identity, or interfere with rooms you are not in.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="7-sdks-apis-and-agents">7. SDKs, APIs, and agents</h2>
        <p>7.1 We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable licence to use the SDKs to develop and operate games that connect to the Service in line with our documentation.</p>
        <p>7.2 Package licences apply to SDK code. These Terms govern use of the hosted Service.</p>
        <p>7.3 You must not use the SDKs or the hosted script to bypass authentication, quotas, sandboxing, or project isolation. You must not import the SDK from a game Web Worker or register a game service worker that caches or intercepts /loki/sdk.js.</p>
        <p>7.4 Agent instructions and command-line checks help integration. You remain responsible for what you or your agent ships.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="8-intellectual-property">8. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>8.1 The Service, protocol, documentation, trade marks, and our software, excluding your Content and third-party open-source components, belong to Reveflo or its licensors.</p>
        <p>8.2 Between you and Reveflo, you retain ownership of your Content.</p>
        <p>8.3 You grant Reveflo a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable licence to host, store, reproduce, adapt, transmit, display, and run Game Content as needed to operate, secure, review, moderate, deliver, and update the Service. This includes running step modules and serving the hosted SDK into your build.</p>
        <p>8.4 You grant Reveflo a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to host, transmit, and display User Content as needed to operate rooms, chat, leaderboards, invites, reports, and safety.</p>
        <p>8.5 If you send suggestions, we may use them without restriction or payment.</p>
        <p>8.6 If you believe Content infringes your intellectual property rights, write to <a href="mailto:contact@lokiplay.cc">contact@lokiplay.cc</a> with your name and contact details, the work and the URL or project, a statement that you own the right or are authorised to act, a statement that the notice is true and in good faith, and your signature. We will acknowledge a complete notice within 5 business days. We may remove or disable the material and end access for repeat infringers. Hong Kong does not operate a United States-style DMCA safe harbour.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="9-acceptable-use">9. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>The AUP is part of these Terms. We may investigate, scan, quarantine, remove Content, revoke credentials and invites, disable a project, suspend an Account, and refer matters to law enforcement. You may ask for a review of a suspension at <a href="mailto:contact@lokiplay.cc">contact@lokiplay.cc</a>. We will consider it. We are not obliged to restore access.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="10-plans-and-payment">10. Plans and payment</h2>
        <p>10.1 Paid Plans are subscriptions processed by Stripe. We do not store your card number. Stripe’s terms apply to the payment method.</p>
        <p>10.2 Prices are in United States dollars and are those shown at checkout. As of this revision they are: Free at US$0; Loki at US$12 per month, or US$8 per month billed annually; Loki Pro at US$20 per month, or US$15 per month billed annually. Taxes are extra unless checkout says otherwise.</p>
        <p>10.3 A subscription renews until you cancel it in the Stripe customer portal from the creator application. After cancellation, paid limits continue until the end of the period already paid. The Account then returns to Free limits. A past-due subscription keeps paid limits until the period end, and then returns to Free if payment is not restored.</p>
        <p>10.4 Fees are not refundable. Cancellation stops the next renewal. It does not refund the current period.</p>
        <p>10.5 We may change prices or Plan limits for future periods by publishing the change under Section 17. The current period keeps the price already paid.</p>
        <p>10.6 A custom Plan exists only when we confirm it in writing. Contacting us does not create a charge.</p>
        <p>10.7 Reveflo is the seller of Loki subscriptions. Creators must not embed their own payment or advertising scripts in games played on Loki.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="11-privacy">11. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Personal data is handled as described in the Privacy Policy. You must not use a game to collect personal data from Players except a display name and score for that game’s leaderboard, unless you give your own lawful notice and the collection is allowed by the AUP and the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486).</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="12-third-parties">12. Third parties</h2>
        <p>The Service depends on Stripe, Supabase, Railway, Cloudflare, GitHub, and Google, as described in the Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for their outages except to the extent Hong Kong law does not allow that exclusion.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="13-hosted-content">13. Hosted content</h2>
        <p>13.1 Creators and Players are solely responsible for Content they upload, host, transmit, or play.</p>
        <p>13.2 We are not responsible for Game Content or User Content, including its legality, accuracy, quality, or safety. Hosting, scanning, or leaving Content online does not make us the publisher or author of that Content, and it is not an approval of that Content.</p>
        <p>13.3 We may remove Content. We have no duty to monitor all Content.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="14-disclaimer-and-exclusion-of-liability">14. Disclaimer and exclusion of liability</h2>
        <p>14.1 The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”.</p>
        <p>14.2 To the fullest extent permitted by the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance (Cap. 71), the Supply of Services (Implied Terms) Ordinance (Cap. 457), the Unconscionable Contracts Ordinance (Cap. 458), and any other law of Hong Kong, we exclude all warranties, conditions, representations, and liability arising out of or in connection with the Service, any Content, or these Terms. The exclusion covers contract, tort (including negligence), statute, and any other basis, and covers direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, and punitive loss, including loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, and business, whether or not foreseeable.</p>
        <p>14.3 Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability for death or personal injury caused by negligence, for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or for any other liability that the law of Hong Kong does not allow to be excluded.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">
        <h2 id="15-indemnity">15. Indemnity</h2>
        <p>You will indemnify Reveflo and its officers, employees, and agents against losses, damages, liabilities, and reasonable legal costs arising out of your Content, your use of the Service, your breach of these Terms or the AUP, or your violation of law or third-party rights. This indemnity does not cover our fraud, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</p>

        <h2 id="16-suspension-and-termination">16. Suspension and termination</h2>
        <p>16.1 You may stop using the Service at any time. Cancel a paid Plan in the billing portal, and request Account deletion at <a href="mailto:contact@lokiplay.cc">contact@lokiplay.cc</a>.</p>
        <p>16.2 We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms or the AUP, if the law requires it, if your use creates security, legal, or operational risk, or if we discontinue the Service.</p>
        <p>16.3 On termination, the licences you granted survive for backups, legal compliance, residual copies, and disputes. Sections 8, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, and 20 survive.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="legal-article">

        <p>19.3 A failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.</p>
        <p>19.4 You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign them to an affiliate or a successor.</p>
        <p>19.5 These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship. Creators are not our agents.</p>
