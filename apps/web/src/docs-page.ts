          <h2>1. Create a project</h2>
          <p>Sign in at <a href="https://app.lokiplay.cc/signup">app.lokiplay.cc</a> and create a project. Copy the project ID. If you use an agent, copy the project prompt from the desk and paste it into the repo.</p>
          <h2>2. Install the client</h2>
          <p>In the game repository, pin the published SDK. Keep the existing stack and UI.</p>
          ${codeBlock(`npm view @lokiplay/sdk@${v} version
npm install @lokiplay/sdk@${v}`)}
          <p>Import it as usual, but leave <code>@lokiplay/sdk</code> external in the production build (Vite: <code>build.rollupOptions.external: ["@lokiplay/sdk"]</code>) and ship an ES module entry. Loki serves the SDK from the game host at <code>/loki/sdk.js</code> and maps the import to it, so compatible networking fixes reach players on refresh without a rebuild. Do not import it from a Web Worker or cache it in a game service worker. Check the finished build with <code>npx lokiplay preview</code> before you ship.</p>
          <p>Optional overlay:</p>
          ${codeBlock(`npm install @lokiplay/ui-web@${v}`)}
          <p>Do not install <code>@loki/*</code>, unofficial packages named Loki, or <code>@heroiclabs/nakama-js</code>.</p>
          <h2>3. Add a room-entry flow</h2>
          <p>Installing the SDK does not add any screen. Run the flow through the lobby controller and build every screen yourself, in the game’s own theme:</p>
          ${codeBlock(`const lobby = client.createLobby({
  makeRoom: () => client.createSynchronizedRoom({ initialState, reduce }),
  minPlayers: 2,
  leaderboardId: "high-scores",
});
lobby.subscribe((state) => render(state)); // phase, room, publicRooms, leaderboard
await lobby.createPrivate();               // or createPublic(), joinWithCode(code), joinPublic(roomId)`)}
          <p>The controller draws nothing. It creates a fresh room for each match, awaits <code>leave()</code> before another entry, times out every creating, joining, and searching step, cancels a search, and decides when the roster is ready to start. Every game builds these screens:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create room, join with an invite code, copy invite, and start when ready.</li>
            <li>A Create private room control and a Create public room control, a public room list, and join from that list.</li>
            <li>A Match control with searching, cancel, timeout, waiting, and error states.</li>
            <li>A per-game Leaderboard with display-name collection or a sensible fallback, plus loading, empty, pagination, submission, and error states.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Public rooms, Match, and the Leaderboard are required in every game. Loki’s SDK does not add a public lobby screen, and the Loki overlay does not create, list, or join rooms. Do not make every room public.</p>
          <p>Player count, teams, and scoring stay creator decisions; if the game has no numeric result to store, ask the creator once what to record instead of inventing a scoring rule. Leaderboards are per-game/project and available to guest sessions without a creator account — client-submitted scores are not an anti-cheat boundary.</p>
          <h2>4. Write <code>game.json</code></h2>
          ${codeBlock(`{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "name": "my-game",
  "entrypoint": "index.html",
  "multiplayer": {
    "enabled": true,
    "authority": "host",
    "maxPlayers": 8,
    "tickRate": 10
  },
  "networkAllowlist": []
}`)}
          <p>Do not invent extra <code>game.json</code> fields. See <a href="/game-json">the manifest</a>.</p>
          <h2>5. Integrate the SDK</h2>
          <p>On a Loki play page, call <code>createHostedLokiClient({ projectId })</code> once at boot. It listens for <code>loki:init</code>, requests the session immediately, and returns an authenticated client. Do not wait for a Create/Join click — the play shell times out around 15 seconds.</p>
          ${codeBlock(`import { createHostedLokiClient } from "@lokiplay/sdk";

const client = await createHostedLokiClient({
  projectId, // the UUID from the creator desk
  fallbackTransport, // optional FirstPartyTransport for local preview
});

const room = client.createSynchronizedRoom({
  initialState,
  reduce,
});

await room.create();
// or: await room.join({ inviteCode });`)}
          <p>Pick <code>createSynchronizedRoom()</code> for turns and discrete events. Pick <code>createRealtimeRoom()</code> only for a continuous host simulation. Do not run both for the same mode. Details: <a href="/multiplayer">multiplayer</a>.</p>
          <h2>6. Log in and connect</h2>
          <p>Login still needs the production API origin in the environment:</p>
          ${codeBlock(`LOKI_API_URL=https://api.lokiplay.cc npx lokiplay@${v} login`)}
          <p>Open the printed URL, confirm the code, and approve this terminal. Then:</p>
          ${codeBlock(`npx lokiplay@${v} connect --project <project-uuid>`)}
          <p>That writes <code>.loki/project.json</code> and <code>AGENTS.md</code>. It does not put secrets in the repo.</p>
          <h2>7. Validate and ship</h2>
          ${codeBlock(`npx lokiplay@${v} validate
npx lokiplay@${v} ship`)}
          <p><code>ship</code> builds the project, copies <code>game.json</code> into the output, validates, uploads a zip, waits for security review, activates the release, and prints a playable URL. A blocked or quarantined build never becomes that URL.</p>
          <h2>8. Fine-tune, then play</h2>
          <p>Open the playable URL. Invite with the 6-digit room code Loki issued. Then keep going: confirm seats and start conditions, fix the lobby, tune the reducer or realtime profile, and ship again. Do not invent room keys.</p>
          <p>The play link does not pick up those changes by itself. Local edits, including <code>game.json</code>, the lobby, and authority, stay off the live URL until <code>ship</code> activates a new release. The same link then serves that release. Reload the page after the ship.</p>

          <h2>You own the game</h2>
          <p>The repository, the UI, the rules, the simulation, and the finished browser build are yours. Fine-tuning seats, modes, lobby copy, and feel stays yours after the SDK is in the tree.</p>
          <h2>Loki owns the platform</h2>
          <p>Identity, tenant boundaries, membership, invite codes, matchmaking, message sequencing, snapshots, host election, quotas, and the playable origin are Loki’s. Never trust a client-supplied player ID, project ID, room key, or membership list over what the SDK returns.</p>

          <p>Upload <code>game.json</code>, <code>index.html</code>, and static assets. Do not upload source-only repos, <code>server.js</code>, secrets, creator ad tags, or localhost URLs.</p>
          <p>The live game runs in a sandboxed iframe on a Loki origin. Production multiplayer is available only from that hosted build.</p>
          <h2>Authority</h2>
          <p>One <code>game.json</code> has one <code>authority</code> for the project. <code>"host"</code> is the default. <code>"server"</code> is opt-in and needs a pinned <code>step</code> module. Rooms already open keep the authority they started with. Switching is another ship, after you mean to switch.</p>
          <p><strong>Host.</strong> A player client is the host. Loki checks that the sender is the current host, sequences messages, and migrates host when that player is gone. Loki cannot prove the host simulated honestly. Use this for casual and unranked play, and for turn-based or event-driven games. It is not ranked anti-cheat.</p>
          <p><strong>Server.</strong> Loki runs the match in a step module. No player is elected host. The module exports one function, <code>step</code>, and imports nothing. The next state may depend only on the previous state and that tick’s inputs. Drawing, sound, and asset loads stay in the browser. Server rooms are browser-only, run in Singapore, and end if the step fails. They do not fall back to a player host. That is a fairness boundary, not a latency upgrade.</p>

          <p>Do not report the integration complete after <code>npm install</code>, <code>lokiplay connect</code>, or the first <code>lokiplay ship</code>. Each game still requires fine-tuning: inspect the real modes, confirm player counts and room type with the creator, add a usable create/join flow, tune the reducer or <code>RealtimeProfile</code>, and exercise reconnect and mobile. If a material field is ambiguous, stop and ask.</p>
          <h2>Hard rules</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Install <code>@lokiplay/sdk@${v}</code>. Do not import Nakama.</li>
            <li>Production multiplayer runs only on a Loki-hosted finished browser build.</li>
            <li>Upload <code>game.json</code>, <code>index.html</code>, and static assets. No backends, secrets, ad tags, or localhost.</li>
            <li>Never override <code>projectId</code>, player identity, membership, or sequence.</li>
            <li><code>createRoom()</code> / <code>joinRoom({ inviteCode })</code>. No invented room keys.</li>
            <li>Run the room flow through <code>client.createLobby()</code> and build every screen in the game’s own theme. The overlay is not that flow.</li>
            <li>Loki’s SDK does not add a public lobby screen. Every game builds the room browser, a Create private room control and a Create public room control, a Match control, and a Leaderboard, with loading, empty, joining, full-room, waiting, readiness, and error states. Do not make every room public.</li>
            <li>Do not invent <code>game.json</code> fields.</li>
            <li>Synchronized vs realtime by state progression, not animation.</li>
            <li>Hosted games: <code>createHostedLokiClient({ projectId })</code> at boot.</li>
            <li>Realtime: calibrate; do not copy <code>snapshotHz</code> into <code>tickRate</code>.</li>
            <li>Let the SDK own lifecycle. Never leave on hide/offline.</li>
            <li><code>dispatch()</code> only while <code>connected</code>.</li>
            <li>For a synchronized room, a control that commits a match action calls <code>dispatch()</code>, and the result is drawn from the snapshot that comes back. Aim, hover, and animation stay local. If the player cannot act, or <code>dispatch()</code> rejects, the control says so.</li>
            <li>CSP: no inline script, no remote fonts/CSS, no <code>&lt;form&gt;</code>.</li>
            <li>Leave <code>@lokiplay/sdk</code> external in the production build; Loki serves it at <code>/loki/sdk.js</code>. Run <code>lokiplay preview</code> before <code>ship</code>.</li>

> Hosting and multiplayer for finished browser games. Host authority is the default. Server authority is opt-in.

Loki hosts a scanned, sandboxed browser build and runs rooms on the same playable URL. Creators do not upload a backend.

## Safety
Installing Loki is not a finished game. Each title still requires fine-tuning after installation. Play the game, adjust the integration, and ship again. You may need to test back and forth before the features work properly for that game.

## Packages
- @lokiplay/sdk@${v} — JavaScript client
- lokiplay@${v} — CLI: login, connect, validate, ship
- @lokiplay/ui-web@${v} — optional overlay (no create/join)
- @lokiplay/mcp@${v} — agent tools, not for the game bundle

## Start
- Docs: https://docs.lokiplay.cc/
- Quickstart: https://docs.lokiplay.cc/quickstart
- Agents: https://docs.lokiplay.cc/agents
- Safety: https://docs.lokiplay.cc/safety
- MCP: https://docs.lokiplay.cc/mcp
- App: https://app.lokiplay.cc/
- Play: https://play.lokiplay.cc/
- API: https://api.lokiplay.cc

## Rules
- Use @lokiplay/sdk. Do not import Nakama or Socket.IO.
- createHostedLokiClient({ projectId }) at boot on hosted play pages.
- createRoom() and joinRoom({ inviteCode }). Loki issues 6-digit codes.
- Public rooms: listPublicRooms() and joinPublic({ roomId }). create() stays invite-only unless visibility is "public". Loki does not add a public lobby screen; the game must build it. Do not make every room public.
- createSynchronizedRoom() for turns/events; createRealtimeRoom() for continuous host simulation. Not both in one mode.
- Calibrate realtime rooms. Do not copy snapshotHz into game.json tickRate.
- Host authority is casual/unranked, not anti-cheat. Server authority runs a pinned step module and does not elect a player host.
- The play link serves the last activated release. Local edits, including game.json and authority, show up only after lokiplay ship.
- Production multiplayer only from a Loki-hosted build.
- Login: LOKI_API_URL=https://api.lokiplay.cc npx lokiplay@${v} login
- No inline scripts, remote fonts, or forms.
- Layer 2 public catalog is closed.
- Loki hosts finished web JavaScript games only. Support for Unity, Godot, iOS, and Android are coming soon. Do not install Loki into a native or engine project.
